For the initial sample preparation, I thank to T. Takayama for giving us the $\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ crystals.
I am grateful to K. Kitagawa and S. Sasaki for guiding and helping the synthesis of the improved crystals by ourselves.
I thank to N. Tateiwa for giving us the advices on using mCAC cell to measure high-pressure magnetic susceptibility.
For the high-pressure measurement of susceptibility, I am grateful to K. Kitagawa, M. Blanckenhorn and S. Sasaki for encouragement and collaboration.
I deeply appreciate the guidance for NMR measurement and high-pressure cell for NMR by K. Kitagawa.
I am grateful for the daily discussion on the experiment with K. Kitatgawa.
I also appreciate the daily interesting, relaxing talk with all members of Takagi-Kitagawa lab.
I am really grateful for the overall supervision by H. Takagi.
Finally, I thank to my friends and my families for spending a joyful time together and always relaxing me.
